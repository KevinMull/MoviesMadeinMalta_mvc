                My interest in Malta as a movie location started way back in the mid 80s whilst on holiday there when I discovered Fort St Elmo in Valletta was used in Midnight Express (1978).  An old time favourite movie of mine.

            Being half Maltese I have since been back many times as I have relatives there and have visited many of the locations featured on this site.  I once stumbled upon Spielberg filming 'Munich' in Valletta in 2005 whilst walking down to the harbour which further fuelled my interest as well as cousins appearing as extras in several productions.

            <p>Note, this site only includes <strong>English language feature films</strong> made in natural locations in Malta, Gozo and Comino so it will not include the likes of Game of Thrones, world cinema or films only using the Rinella Water Tanks.</p>
